# This experiment is to test the relationship between RTT, throughput with respect to interference

## Experiment: Find the relationship between RTT when the File Limitation changes -- File Interference

Setup:

+ 4 nodes: A -- Project, B -- File, C -- Interference (File), D -- AP
  + A transmit to the AP, B transmit to the AP, C transmit to the AP
  + B with different file size (OR limitation)
  + Collect the data of A, B, C

## Experiment: Find the realtionship between throughput when the File Limitation changes -- File Interference

Setup:

+ 4 nodes: A -- File, B -- File, C -- Interference (File), D -- AP
  + A transmit to the AP, B transmit to the AP, C transmit to the AP
  + B with different file size (OR limitation)
  + Collect the data of A, B, C
  
## Experiment: Find the relationship between RTT when the File Limitation changes -- Proj Interference

Setup:

+ 4 nodes: A -- Project, B -- File, C -- Interference (Project), D -- AP
  + A transmit to the AP, B transmit to the AP, C transmit to the AP
  + B with different file size (OR limitation)
  + Collect the data of A, B, C
