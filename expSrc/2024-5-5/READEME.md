# Experiment on the Link Switching #

In this experiment the effect of link switching experiment is required, where three experiment components are required to be examined.

+ **Experiment 1**: When the channel becoming worse, the forward link switching is required to be examined.
+ **Experiment 2**: Vision of the dynamic transmission part changing.
+ **Experiment 3**: When the channel becoming better, the backward link switching is required to be examined.
    + RTT prediction: utilizing the predicted result, the link determine whether to switch or not.
